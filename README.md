#Python Port Scanner
This project is a simple port scanner developed in Python. It is designed to scan a specified range of ports on a target machine to determine which ports are open and accepting connections.

# Features
* Customizable Port Range: Allows users to specify the range of ports to scan.
* Concurrent Scanning: Utilizes multithreading to speed up the scanning process.
* Port Status: Displays whether each port is open.
* Target Specification: Users can specify the target IP address or hostname.
# Technologies Used
* Python: The programming language used for development.
* Socket: A Python library for low-level network interface.
* Threading: A Python module to implement multithreading for faster scanning.
